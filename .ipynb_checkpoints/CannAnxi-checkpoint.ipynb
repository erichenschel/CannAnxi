      "per sam the skunkman, “south african durban poison was first introduced by me. i got maybe 100 seeds from south africa and grew them in california in the late 70s. most were hermaphrodite, small calyxes, as well as not so great buds. but i saw the potential for an early sativa so i worked with it for a few years to clean it up. i finally eliminated most of all the bad traits, and introduced it in the early 80s.”\n",
